| Local tool runtime (3-5 tools) | practical daily utility | strict validation/sandboxing | Implemented (WP-05 closed) | Implemented (UI action + success/failure paths validated) |
| Memory v1 | continuity across sessions | retrieval quality + retention policy | Implemented (file-backed + pruning) | Implemented (session restore/switch continuity validated) |
| Single-image Q&A | multimodal differentiation | image path latency and correctness | Implemented (WP-06 closed) | Implemented (image attach success/failure UX validated) |
| Offline policy-aware network enforcement | trust and privacy claim integrity | strict runtime boundary wiring | Implemented (ENG-17) | Implemented (runtime startup checks + UX messaging) |
| Resilience and startup guards | reduce crash/startup failure support load | guard correctness across OEM behavior | Implemented (WP-07 resilience closeout) | Implemented (runtime error banners + startup status) |
| Runtime backend transparency | support/debug can identify runtime path quickly | backend identity correctness | Implemented | Implemented (backend chip + advanced-sheet backend details) |
| Structured UI error contracts | deterministic support and triage | stable error-code mapping | Implemented | Implemented (`UI-STARTUP-001`, `UI-IMG-VAL-001`, `UI-TOOL-SCHEMA-001`, `UI-RUNTIME-001`) |

## Out of Scope for Current MVP

1. Broad video analytics workflows
2. On-device training/fine-tuning
3. Unbounded autonomous agent loops
4. Cloud-dependent default path

## Feature Prioritization Rules

1. Must improve daily utility for ICP users.
2. Must preserve local-first privacy guarantees.
3. Must pass benchmark, reliability, and UI acceptance gates.
4. Must not destabilize current stage commitments.
