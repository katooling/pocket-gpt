# WP-09 QA Rollout Quality Checkpoints (Initial Packet)

Date: 2026-03-04  
Owner: QA Lead  
Status: Completed (initial QA-09 deliverable set)

## Objective

Define QA-owned rollout quality checkpoints to support WP-09 distribution and beta operations execution after WP-07/WP-11 gate closure.

## Inputs Reviewed

1. `docs/operations/execution-board.md`
2. `docs/operations/role-playbooks/qa-playbook.md`
3. `docs/operations/evidence/wp-09/2026-03-04-prod-06-kickoff.md`
4. `docs/roadmap/mvp-beta-go-no-go-packet.md`
5. `docs/testing/test-strategy.md`

## QA Checkpoint Set (WP-09 Support)

1. Cohort entry gate:
   - Build provenance recorded (commit + build timestamp).
   - `bash scripts/dev/test.sh ci` status captured.
   - Latest go/no-go references attached (`WP-07`, `WP-11` closure evidence).
2. Device rollout guard:
   - Required-tier device execution references attached.
   - Best-effort-tier caveats explicitly documented in rollout notes.
3. Incident triage loop:
   - Severity buckets (`S0`/`S1`/`S2`/`S3`) mapped to owner + response SLA.
   - Crash/OOM/ANR evidence path convention enforced (for example: `scripts/benchmarks/runs/2026-03-04/DEVICE_SERIAL_REDACTED/qa-06-soak-20260304-095133/`).
4. Beta feedback quality gate:
   - Reproduction template includes app version, device model, Android version, prompt/workflow, and observed behavior.
   - Reports missing reproducibility fields are marked `Needs-Info`.
5. Release-promotion gate:
   - No unresolved `S0`/`S1` defects.
   - Product + QA review checkpoint logged with evidence links.
6. UX quality extension gate (WP-13 aligned):
   - Onboarding path regression status captured weekly.
   - Runtime/model status clarity checks captured weekly.
   - Privacy sheet, natural-language tool path, and Scenario C continuity checks captured weekly.
   - Promotion notes include latest instrumentation + Maestro PASS run ids and RC real-runtime app-path smoke id when applicable.

## QA Deliverables for WP-09 (Next)

1. Beta incident triage template (severity + ownership + evidence links): `docs/operations/evidence/wp-09/2026-03-04-qa-wp09-incident-triage-template.md`
2. QA release-promotion checklist for cohort expansion decisions: `docs/operations/evidence/wp-09/2026-03-04-qa-wp09-release-promotion-checklist.md`
3. Weekly QA rollout quality summary format (defect trends + device class impact): `docs/operations/evidence/wp-09/2026-03-04-qa-wp09-weekly-rollout-summary-template.md`

## Current QA Decision

1. WP-09 QA support is active and unblocked.
2. No remaining QA blocker from WP-07/WP-11 gate dependencies.
3. Initial QA-09 template packet is complete; execution now proceeds through weekly operations cadence.
